# 📊 Flexoelectric properties of MoS2 by multiscale simulations

This script processes and visualizes flexoelectric properties of 2D MoS2 monolayer by combining DFT simulations with multiscale simulations.

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Normalization of z-coordinates using reference heights
- ✅ Decomposition of raw datasets into shifted groups (A, B, C, D)
- ✅ Visualization of raw and transformed atomic positions
- ✅ The program works by disecting the MoS2 monolayer in small dipoles.
